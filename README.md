# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

The purpose of this was to utilize unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms to analyze the cryptocurrency market. To do this I preprocessed the data, reduced data dimensions using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, clustered the cryptocurrencies using K-means, and finally created visualizations to show the results.     

## Results
